# Odin Recipes üç©
This is the first project introduced in the curriculum of Foundations learning
path of The Odin Project. Aim of this project is to practice basic HTML skills.
Later parts of the curriculum also introducec the use of CSS in the project.
It consists of a collection of recipes. Recipes can vary per students'
implementation. My project contains some Pizza recipes. This can be a nice
project for any beginner learning web designing.
